Set up
------

In order to set up solution and projects (in a platform independant way) the [Forge](http://fsprojects.github.io/Forge/ "Forge project page") tool will be used.

Follow instructions on its page in order to install it properly. When it is in place follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your root folder (i.e. /path/to/starships/)
1. Run: `forge new`

    a) Type solution name (i.e.: _Starships_)

    b) Choose empty relative path (hit enter)

    c) Choose `sln` template

1. Run `forge new`

    a) Type web project name (i.e.: _Starships.Web_)

    b) Choose relative path: (i.e.: _./Starships/_)

    c) Choose `suave` template

As a result there should be a proper solution, project and build files in place.
